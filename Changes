Changes
===========================

Between Lab::Instrument, Lab::Tools, and the initial release of Lab::Measurement
(Summary of the most important points only)


Lab::Measurement
  * The default file suffixes have been changed from "DATA" and "META" to "dat" 
    and "meta".

Lab::Instrument
  * The back-end has been completely restructured, introducing the classes 
    Lab::Connection and Lab::Bus.
  * SR830: functions like get_range and get_tc do not return strings anymore, 
    but values in SI base units
