=head1 NAME

Lab::Connection::VISA_RS232 - RS232-type connection class which uses L<Lab::Bus::VISA> 
and thus NI VISA (L<Lab::VISA>) as a backend.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

This class is not called directly. To make a RS232 suppporting instrument use 
Lab::Connection::VISA_RS232, set the connection_type parameter accordingly:

 $instrument = new BlaDeviceType(
    connection_type => 'VISA_RS232',
    port => 'ASRL1',
 )

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<Lab::Connection::VISA_RS232> provides a RS232-type connection with L<Lab::Bus::VISA> using
NI VISA (L<Lab::VISA>) as backend.

It inherits from L<Lab::Connection::RS232> and subsequently from L<Lab::Connection>.

The main feature is to set upon initialization all the RS232 libe parameters
  baud_rate
  ...

=head1 CONSTRUCTOR

=head2 new

 my $connection = new Lab::Connection::VISA_RS232(
    port => 'ASRL1',
    baud_rate => 9600,
 )


=head1 METHODS

This just falls back on the methods inherited from L<Lab::Connection>.


=head2 config

Provides unified access to the fields in initial @_ to all the child classes.
E.g.

 $GPIB_Address=$instrument->Config(gpib_address);

Without arguments, returns a reference to the complete $self->Config aka @_ of the constructor.

 $Config = $connection->Config();
 $GPIB_Address = $connection->Config()->{'gpib_address'};
 
=head1 CAVEATS/BUGS

Probably few. Mostly because there's not a lot to be done here. Please report.
