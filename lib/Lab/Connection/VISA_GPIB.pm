=head1 NAME

Lab::Connection::VISA_GPIB - GPIB-type connection class which uses L<Lab::Bus::VISA> 
and thus NI VISA (L<Lab::VISA>) as a backend.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

This class is not called directly. To make a GPIB suppporting instrument use 
Lab::Connection::VISA_GPIB, set the connection_type parameter accordingly:

 $instrument = new HP34401A(
    connection_type => 'VISA_GPIB',
    gpib_board => 0,
    gpib_address => 14
 )

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<Lab::Connection::VISA_GPIB> provides a GPIB-type connection with L<Lab::Bus::VISA> using
NI VISA (L<Lab::VISA>) as backend.

It inherits from L<Lab::Connection::GPIB> and subsequently from L<Lab::Connection>.

The main feature is to assemble the standard gpib connection options
  gpib_board
  gpib_address
  gpib_saddress
into a valid NI VISA resource name (see L<Lab::Connection::VISA> for more details).

=head1 CONSTRUCTOR

=head2 new

 my $connection = new Lab::Connection::VISA_GPIB(
    gpib_board => 0,
    gpib_address => $address,
    gpib_saddress => $secondary_address
 }


=head1 METHODS

This just falls back on the methods inherited from L<Lab::Connection>.


=head2 config

Provides unified access to the fields in initial @_ to all the child classes.
E.g.

 $GPIB_Address=$instrument->Config(gpib_address);

Without arguments, returns a reference to the complete $self->Config aka @_ of the constructor.

 $Config = $connection->Config();
 $GPIB_Address = $connection->Config()->{'gpib_address'};
 
=head1 CAVEATS/BUGS

Probably few. Mostly because there's not a lot to be done here. Please report.
