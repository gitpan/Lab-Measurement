=head1 NAME

Lab::Connection::IsoBus - IsoBus connection class which uses L<Lab::Bus::IsoBus> as a backend.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

This is not called directly. To make an Isobus instrument use Lab::Connection::IsoBus, set
the connection_type parameter accordingly:

$instrument = new ILM210(
   connection_type => 'IsoBus',
   isobus_address => 3,
)

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<Lab::Connection::IsoBus> provides a connection with L<Lab::Bus::IsoBus>, 
transparently handled via a pre-existing bus and connection object (e.g. serial or GPIB).

It inherits from L<Lab::Connection>.


=head1 CONSTRUCTOR

=head2 new

 my $connection = new Lab::Connection::IsoBus(
   connection_type => 'IsoBus',
   isobus_address => 3,
 }


=head1 METHODS

This just falls back on the methods inherited from L<Lab::Connection>.


=head2 config

Provides unified access to the fields in initial @_ to all the child classes.
E.g.

 $IsoBus_Address=$instrument->Config(isobus_address);

Without arguments, returns a reference to the complete $self->Config aka @_ of the constructor.

 $Config = $connection->Config();
 $IsoBus_Address = $connection->Config()->{'isobus_address'};
 
=head1 CAVEATS/BUGS

Probably few. Mostly because there's not a lot to be done here. Please report.
