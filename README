README for Lab::Measurement
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Lab::Measurement allows to perform test and measurement tasks with Perl scripts. It 
provides an interface to several instrumentation control backends, as e.g. Linux-GPIB or 
National Instruments' NI-VISA library. Dedicated instrument driver classes relieve the 
user from taking care for internal details.
