README for Lab::Instrument
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

This package builds on top of the Lab::VISA interface to the NI-VISA library.

Lab::Instrument offers an abstract interface to an instrument that is connected via
GPIB, serial connection, ethernet, USB, or whatever else the NI-VISA library supports. 
In addition Oxford Instruments IsoBus is also supported.
The package provides general Read(), Write() and Query() methods.

Derived from Lab::Instrument there are specialized instrument classes
(virtual instruments) such as Lab::Instrument::HP34401A, that offer even more high
level comfort with methods like read_voltage().
